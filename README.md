# Intro-to-Nuxt-

Nuxt.js is not a server side framework. It runs on the servers. It renders the first page and after the first page is renderd, the Vue.js app takes over.

# Notes
1)  Routing is done automatically
2)  Directories:- ***
    1)The pages directory contains your application's views and routes. 
    2)The components directory is where you put all your Vue.js components which are then imported into your pages.
    3)The assets directory contains your styles, images, or fonts.
    4)The package.json file contains all the dependencies and scripts.
